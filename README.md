# Work Day Schedule
## Project 
In this project we were given starter code and had to add code to make a schedule for a day from 9am-5pm and add features to show past presetn and future.
## Design
The design aspect is the same as the one that was given, but using functions, VAR, query slectors, a lot of if else statements.
## Closing 
The code will run smoothly in browser, I doubled checked to see if the color schemes update on past, present, and future times.
